## 🔍 Key Findings

### 😷🦠 COVID-19 Impact

*   Unemployment was **stable before COVID**
*   During lockdown there was a → **sharp spike**📈
*   Some months show **very high values (15–35%)**, far above normal levels📶
*   After restrictions eased → gradual recovery

**Conclusion:**

COVID caused a **sudden shock**, not a slow increase.

### 📅 Seasonal Trends

*   Small monthly fluctuations normally
*   Rural/agriculture jobs might have shown seasonal effects
*   Festive/harvest months → lower unemployment
*   Lockdown months break this pattern

**Conclusion:**

Seasonality exists, but **crises dominate trends**.

### 🏙️ Regional Patterns
* Urban areas were shown from visualizations to have a slightly harder hit; reasonable due to more availabilty of jobs in such areas.<img width="996" height="974" alt="India covid pic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d0988d-4b52-4b53-bf79-18b932b821ff" />
 (services, retail, travel)
* Rural areas slightly more stable (agriculture, govt schemes)
* Big differences across states

*Conclusion:*
Impact was *uneven*, not uniform.

## 📈 Distribution Insight

* Most unemployment rates: *3–10%*
* Few extreme spikes create a *right-skewed distribution*
* These spikes represent pandemic months
